There are two case about images's responsive:

1. case 1 (horizantal case) : let suppose we have screen conatin slider --> [it's called image coursel], subtitel and some details about the product at the top of the screen there is a slider 
so to perform it you should use flatlist and to make it sutable with all screens you should to take into considation some standers
[width, height] so if you have four images into the slider so the images width should be fit with the screen and the height should 
set depend on the width it's like a sequare so to do that there are two thisngs: 
                                                                                1. useWindowsDimenssion(): this return the dimenssion of the screen 
                                                                                2. aspectRatio : this Calibrate the height depnds on the width and visa versa 
                                                                                   such as [1:1]


2. case 2 (Vertical case) : if you have screen contains two columns of anything you should take into consdration two things
   first the outter container of column should devied into two part you can see an example if you visit the product screen
