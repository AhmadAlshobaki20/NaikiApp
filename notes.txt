There are two case about images's responsive:

1. case 1 (horizantal case) : let suppose we have screen conatin slider --> [it's called image coursel], subtitel and some details about the product at the top of the screen there is a slider 
so to perform it you should use flatlist and to make it sutable with all screens you should to take into considation some standers
[width, height] so if you have four images into the slider so the images width should be fit with the screen and the height should 
set depend on the width it's like a sequare so to do that there are two thisngs: 
                                                                                1. useWindowsDimenssion(): this return the dimenssion of the screen 
                                                                                2. aspectRatio : this Calibrate the height depnds on the width and visa versa 
                                                                                   such as [1:1]


2. case 2 (Vertical case) : if you have screen contains two columns of anything you should take into consdration two things
   first the outter container of column should devied into two part you can see an example if you visit the product screen



this object gives us two props
    1. Stack.Navigator => this what we will wrap all our components by it
    2. Stack.Screen => this refer to the routes

Stack.Screen expect two required props which are name and component
we can provide a components inside the route for example icons

because the option is inside the route it does not have access to the navigation object so we have to
     choices to perform navigate here :
        1. set function that return an jsx inside option props
        2. separate component to another file which will return jsx
